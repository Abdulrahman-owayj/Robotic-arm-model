# Robotic-arm-model
Here i assympled a 3D design of a robotic arm with a grapper at the end

To be able to reassymble the same arm you can check the technical report repositry where i provided a clear instruction on how to assymble the parts one by one.
But in this repositry i provided the final result of the arm in stl file.

to find the parts and reassymble them yourself check this link of the (smart methods) company where you can open the robotic arm repositry and open the arm package file > meshes stl then downloading the parts and use any 3D software to assymble them, for example but not limited to (blunder, tinkercad, fusion ....etc).
